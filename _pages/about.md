I am a Prinicipal Engineer at the [Digital Hub](https://medium.com/d-classified), 
the [Defence Science and Technolgy Agency (DSTA)](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/), Singapore, 
where I develop robotics solutions for public and military applications.

I am broadly interested in developing generalizable, trustworthy techniques to 
enable robot autonomy for complex real-world tasks. My current work is focused 
on multi-agent exploration for search and rescue. I also do work on object 
detection and tracking and synthetic data generation.

I was previously in the Land Systems Programme Centre at DSTA and worked on
robot system architecture and system integration.

I was visiting researcher at the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org), 
[Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)
where I worked with [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/)
and [Yaoyu Hu](https://theairlab.org/team/yaoyuh/).

I was a member of the Robot Autonomy Programme (now part of the Robotics Division) at 
[DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg/) and worked with 
[Hikaru Fujishima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hikaru-fujishima) and 
[Stephen Chai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-chai-kian-ping-2896582/) on autonomous
offroad driving.

I did my Bachelor's and Master's in Mechanical Engineering at the
[George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/), 
[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a concentration
in controls, automation and robotics. I was a receipient of the 
[DSTA Scholarship](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/join-us/student/scholarships-awards).
